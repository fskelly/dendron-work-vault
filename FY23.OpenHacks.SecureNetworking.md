# December 2022
Trial run hack with external parties

# Feb 2023
TSI OpenHack for internal staff
## Key Learnings
1. Being a coach for two teams is too distracting and not fully beneficail to all teams
2. Documentation updates are needed
3. THe hack needs to be more closed and more guided
4. With the OpenHack being so open, getting to all challenges is an issue.
